Some notes on how to use the middleman blog

# - To create an article:

middleman article ARTICLENAME

# - This adds a new blog article to the source folder

# - Edit this in markdown...

# - Then check the source into the GIT master branch:  (the source only!)

git status
git add .
git commit -am "with a relevant message"
git push origin master

# - Then build and publish

rake build

rake publish

# - the publish script checks the build into the gh-pages branch which is what becomes the actual static site!
